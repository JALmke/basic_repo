I first created the basic repo called basic_repo. Following this, I added a few simple files. Index.html, style.css, and basicrepo.txt. After checking their status and committing these files, I added part of a quote to the basicrepo.txt file. I then pushed the repository to GitHub following the provided directions. I then updated the quote in basicrepo.txt and created this file which I uploaded with the updated repository.
